# List of summaries for courses

### Background

Here in RWTH, exams are easy but we need to memorize something to get better grades. I often find it useful to summarize the most important contents of the courses I taken.

### Note

The contents are in English, with some side notes in Chinese. Because of the limitation of my capability and carelessness, there might be some mistakes. Hope you can use it as a supplementary material to the slides.
