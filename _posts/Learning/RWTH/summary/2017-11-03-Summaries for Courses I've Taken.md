### Background

Here in RWTH, exams are easy but we need to memorize something to get better grades. I often find it useful to summarize the most important contents of the courses I've taken.

### Note

The contents are in English, with some side notes in Chinese. Because of my incapability and carelessness, there might be some mistakes. Hope you can use it as a supplementary material to the slides.
